## Fraud Specialist √ó AI/Automation Engineer √ó Crypto Enthusiast

I build pragmatic tools at the intersection of **fraud/AML**, **risk analytics**, **crypto markets**, and **LLM-powered automation**. My background combines an M.S. in Finance (focus: fraud management) with hands‚Äëon Python/TypeScript engineering‚Äîscrapers, agents, dashboards, and **market/data pipelines** that solve real problems.

---

### What I‚Äôm Focused On

- **MCP Tools & Agents**: Building servers for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework for plugging on-chain/off-chain data sources directly into LLM workflows for jobs, markets, and risk intelligence.
- **Crypto Market Automation**: Developing Playwright + headless pipelines to capture charts/heatmaps, scan for trading signals, and deliver real-time alerts via platforms like Telegram.
- **Developer Experience**: Creating small but powerful open-source utilities (like MkDocs plugins) that accelerate documentation, prototyping, and data exploration.
