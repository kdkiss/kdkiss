# Hi, I'm Kolja 👋

**Fraud Specialist × AI/Automation Engineer × Crypto Enthusiast**

I build pragmatic tools at the intersection of **fraud/AML**, **risk analytics**, **crypto markets**, and **LLM-powered automation**. My background combines an M.S. in Finance (focus: fraud management) with hands‑on Python/TypeScript engineering—scrapers, agents, dashboards, and **market/data pipelines** that solve real problems.

---

## What I’m working on

* **MCP tools & agents** – Model Context Protocol servers that plug on‑chain/off‑chain sources straight into LLM workflows (jobs, markets, risk intel).
* **Crypto market automation** – Playwright + headless pipelines for capturing charts/heatmaps, scanning signals, and delivering alerts (e.g., Telegram bots).
* **Developer experience** – Small but punchy OSS utilities (MkDocs plugins, templates) that speed up docs, prototyping, and data exploration.

## Selected projects

*Crypto focus: liquidation heatmaps, signal scanners, and market data pipelines.*

* **[mcp-stepstone](https://github.com/kdkiss/mcp-stepstone)** – StepStone job search via MCP. Reliable scraping with Playwright, structured JSON output, easy drop‑in for agents.
* **[mcp-liquidation-map](https://github.com/kdkiss/mcp-liquidation-map)** – Capture and encode crypto liquidation heatmaps (Playwright), optimized for agent workflows.
* **[telegram-liquidation-maps](https://github.com/kdkiss/telegram-liquidation-maps)** – End‑to‑end pipeline to fetch, process, and deliver liquidation heatmaps to Telegram.
* **[crypto-signal-scanner](https://github.com/kdkiss/crypto-signal-scanner)** – Detects TD9, Elliott, MACD/RSI signals; sends annotated alerts.
* **[mkdocs\_quiz\_plugin](https://github.com/kdkiss/mkdocs_quiz_plugin)** & **[mkdocs-bootstrap-elements-plugin](https://github.com/kdkiss/mkdocs-bootstrap-elements-plugin)** – Handy MkDocs plugins for interactive docs and Bootstrap components.
* **[breakoutpropterminal](https://github.com/kdkiss/breakoutpropterminal)** – Electron‑based trading terminal prototype.
