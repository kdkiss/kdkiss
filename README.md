# Fraud & Financial Crime Specialist · AI Automation & Agentic Systems

I work at the intersection of **fraud investigation, AML compliance, and applied AI automation** inside regulated financial environments.  
My focus is on building **LLM-assisted workflows** that reduce manual analytic load, improve consistency, and increase defensibility of decisions.

---

## Selected Work (evidence of focus)

- **`aml-sar-drafting-agent-suite`** — AI-assisted orchestration for consistent, policy-aligned SAR narrative drafting
- **`fraud-case-triage-orchestrator`** — Agentic pre-classification & enrichment layer for fraud case workflows before analyst review
- **`regflow-compliance-monitor`** — Continuous rule-conformance monitoring against internal controls & regulatory requirements

> These projects reflect **production-grade thinking**: alignment to banking constraints, auditability, explainability, and risk posture.

## What I actually build
AI systems that assist — not replace — regulated decision-making by:
- Pre-structuring fraud/AML inputs before analyst review
- Orchestrating multi-agent analysis against legal & bank rules
- Generating draft artefacts (e.g. SAR narratives) with audit-trace
- Embedding regulatory guardrails into automated flows

<summary><strong>Architecture & Methods (click to expand)</strong></summary>

- **Agentic orchestration**: CrewAI, strategy trees, context-scoped tool access
- **Data stack**: Python, SQL, ETL for investigation-grade inputs
- **Reasoning constraints**: policy-aligned prompt control, defensive LLM usage
- **Workload targets**: case triage, enrichment, narrative generation, rule checks
- **Non-numerical success criteria**: consistency, defensibility, throughput, auditability

<summary><strong>Fraud / AML / Compliance Domain Scope (click to expand)</strong></summary>

- Fraud case investigation & pre-arbitration workflows
- AML fundamentals: SAR drafting logic, red flags, typologies
- Governance & controls: internal rule adherence, explainability
- Regulatory context awareness (EU banking & financial crime)

<summary><strong>Other Technical Areas (crypto analytics / market structure) — reduced scope</strong></summary>

Applied crypto/market microstructure projects retained only where analytically transferable
(e.g. liquidation heatmapping, automated capture logic, risk-driven alerting), now positioned
as **methodology**, not career identity.
